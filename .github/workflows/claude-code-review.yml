            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions. Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
            Do not give a star-rating to evaluate performance. Avoid "celebratory" emojis (rockets, partyhats, etc) and
            use Emojis only where they help in styling e.g. a green checkbox, red cross to  designate things that are working/not working.
