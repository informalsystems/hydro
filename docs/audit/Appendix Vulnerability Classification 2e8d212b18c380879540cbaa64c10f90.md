# Appendix: Vulnerability Classification

For classifying vulnerabilities identified in the findings of this report, we employ the simplified version of[Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document), which is an industry standard vulnerability metric. For each identified vulnerability we assess the scores from the*Base Metric Group*, the[Impact score](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#2-3-Impact-Metrics), and the[Exploitability score](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#2-1-Exploitability-Metrics). The*Exploitability score*reflects the ease and technical means by which the vulnerability can be exploited. That is, it represents characteristics of the*thing that is vulnerable*, which we refer to formally as the*vulnerable component*. The*Impact score*reflects the direct consequence of a successful exploit, and represents the consequence to the*thing that suffers the impact*, which we refer to formally as the*impacted component*. In order to ease score understanding, we employ[CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document#Qualitative-Severity-Rating-Scale), and abstract numerical scores into the textual representation; we construct the final*Severity score*막ased on the combination of the Impact and Exploitability sub-scores.

As blockchains are a fast evolving field, we evaluate the scores not only for the present state of the system, but also for the state that deems achievable within 1 year of projected system evolution. E.g., if at present the system interacts with 1-2 other blockchains, but plans to expand interaction to 10-20 within the next year, we evaluate the impact, exploitability, and severity scores wrt. the latter state, in order to give the system designers better understanding of the vulnerabilities that need to be addressed in the near future.

### Impact Score

The Impact score captures the effects of a successfully exploited vulnerability on the component that suffers the worst outcome that is most directly and predictably associated with the attack.

| **Impact Score** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- |
| 游먝**High** | Halting of the chain; loss, locking, or unauthorized withdrawal of funds of many users; arbitrary transaction execution; forging of user messages / circumvention of authorization logic |
| 游리 **Medium** | Temporary denial of service / substantial unexpected delays in processing user requests (e.g. many hours/days); loss, locking, or unauthorized withdrawal of funds of a single user / few users; failures during transaction execution (e.g. out of gas errors); substantial increase in node computational requirements (e.g. 10x) |
| 游릭 **Low** | Transient unexpected delays in processing user requests (e.g. minutes/a few hours); Medium increase in node computational requirements (e.g. 2x); any kind of problem that affects end users, but can be repaired by manual intervention (e.g. a special transaction) |
| 游댯 **None** | Small increase in node computational requirements (e.g. 20%); code inefficiencies; bad code practices; lack/incompleteness of tests; lack/incompleteness of documentation |

### Exploitability Score

The Exploitability score reflects the ease and technical means by which the vulnerability can be exploited; it represents the characteristics of the vulnerable component. In the below table we list, for each category, examples of actions by actors that are enough to trigger the exploit. In the examples below:

- *Actors*맊an be any entity that interacts with the system: other blockchains, system users, validators, relayers, but also uncontrollable phenomena (e.g. network delays or partitions).
- *Actions*맊an be
    - *legitimate*, e.g. submission of a transaction that follows protocol rules by a user; delegation/redelegation/bonding/unbonding; validator downtime; validator voting on a single, but alternative block; delays in relaying certain messages, or speeding up relaying other messages;
    - *illegitimate*, e.g. submission of a specially crafted transaction (not following the protocol, or e.g. with large/incorrect values); voting on two different alternative blocks; alteration of relayed messages.
- We employ also a*qualitative measure*representing the amount of certain class of power (e.g. possessed tokens, validator power, relayed messages):*small*맍or < 3%;*medium*맍or 3-10%;*large*맍or 10-33%,*all*맍or >33%. We further quantify this qualitative measure as relative to the largest of the system components. (e.g. when two blockchains are interacting, one with a large capitalization, and another with a small capitalization, we employ*small*망rt. the number of tokens held, if it is small wrt. the large blockchain, even if it is large wrt. the small blockchain)

| **Exploitability Score** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- |
| 游 **High** | illegitimate actions taken by a small group of actors; possibly coordinated with legitimate actions taken by a medium group of actors |
| 游리 **Medium** | illegitimate actions taken by a medium group of actors; possibly coordinated with legitimate actions taken by a large group of actors |
| 游릭 **Low** | illegitimate actions taken by a large group of actors; possibly coordinated with legitimate actions taken by all actors |
| 游댯 **None** | illegitimate actions taken in a coordinated fashion by all actors |

### Severity Score

The severity score combines the above two sub-scores into a single value, and roughly represents the probability of the system suffering a severe impact with time; thus it also represents the measure of the urgency or order in which vulnerabilities need to be addressed. We assess the severity according to the combination scheme represented graphically below.

As can be seen from the image above, only a combination of high impact with high exploitability results in a Critical severity score; such vulnerabilities need to be addressed ASAP. Accordingly, High severity score receive vulnerabilities with the combination of high impact and medium exploitability, or medium impact, but high exploitability.

| **Severity Score** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- |
| 游댮 **Critical** | Halting of chain via a submission of a specially crafted transaction |
| 游 **High** | Permanent loss of user funds via a combination of submitting a specially crafted transaction with delaying of certain messages by a large portion of relayers |
| 游리 **Medium** | Substantial unexpected delays in processing user requests via a combination of delaying of certain messages by a large group of relayers with coordinated withdrawal of funds by a large group of users |
| 游릭 **Low** | 2x increase in node computational requirements via coordinated withdrawal of all user tokens |
| 游댯 **Informational** | Code inefficiencies; bad code practices; lack/incompleteness of tests; lack/incompleteness of documentation; any exploit for which a coordinated illegitimate action of all actors is necessary |
