## Cutting a new release

### Creating the changelog

To create a new release, you will need to have [unclog](https://github.com/informalsystems/unclog) installed.

First, run:
```
unclog release vX.Y.Z --editor nano
```
This will move all the changelog entries from the `unreleased` folder into a new folder named after the release tag. It will also open an editor for you to write the release notes.
For the release notes, include the date (as in `Date: October 15th, 2024`). You can
optionally add a short summary of the release, but do not duplicate the changelog entries.

Then, regenerate the `CHANGELOG` by running
```
unclog build > CHANGELOG
```
Finally, commit and push the changes to the repo.
The up-to-date changelog should be present on the release branch for the release you have just cut,
and also on main. 

### Updating versions

Modify the versions in the `Cargo.toml` files for all contracts that the release is for.

### Migration

Make sure that the migration entrypoint in `contract/src/migration/migrate.rs` has the correct behaviour for the upgrade.
That means it uses the right Migration message, and calls the right migration function.

### Building/Releasing

Run `make compile` to regenerate the contracts with the new version number.

### Cutting the release

Create a PR with these changes, in the usual cases targetting main.
After the changes are merged into main, push the changes from main to the release branch, e.g. `release/v3.x`.
Then, on Github, create a new tag from the branch, and release that tag.
As summary, use the CHANGELOG entry for that release, e.g.
```
## v3.1.1
Date: Feburary 25th, 2025
